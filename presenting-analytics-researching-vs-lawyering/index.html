<p>I've noticed there are two "rhetorical strategies" that almost all business-related presentations follow. The first strategy, which I've called researching, is about explaining what's happened and why it happened that way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Revenue growth was lagging this quarter as we had fewer repeat customers come back through our re-marketing channels. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second strategy, which I've called lawyering, is about getting the audience to respond to the presentation in a specific way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to scale up our re-marketing campaigns this quarter in order to hit our end of year revenue goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most people tend to prefer one strategy over the other, and they're reluctant to ever use both. For example, some people find the directness of the lawyering strategy manipulative, and they view the people that use that kind of rhetoric as ruthless mercenaries willing to say whatever it takes to earn a buck. They might think something like - "Of course you want us to spend more on re-marketing, <em>you're the re-marketing person!</em>"</p>
<p>Similarly, some people find the researching strategy tedious to follow, and they'll get frustrated listening to the presentation because it feels unproductive. They might think something like - "I know our revenue is down, but my question is what are we supposed to do about it? <em>We're losing time here!</em>"</p>
<ul>
<li>Most people (especially non-technical people) actually tend to prefer the lawyering style.</li>
<li>Of course, most people wouldn't ask those questions out loud because they're a little bit rude. But if you've ever had someone give you feedback about your "presentation style," there's a very good chance what they're really asking for is for you to be more "lawyering." Everyone gets this feedback from someone eventually, and I got it early on my career from someone who appreciated that it was just a rhetorical strategy. He called it "direct presentation style," but the idea was the same.</li>
<li>Most analytics presentations tend to follow the researching strategy, because they're written by researchers.</li>
<li>The strategies shouldn't be viewed as an "either or." You should pick whichever makes the most sense for your context.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/library/2u-how-to-build-your-seed-round-pitch-deck">Pitch deck template from YC</a> follows the researching strategy, and the closest it gets to lawyering is in the last slide where they define the amount of money needed. The researching strategy works well in this context because </li>
<li>I need another example to show 'lawyering' at its most effective.</li>
<li>Fitting the facts to the story, vs fitting the store to the facts.</li>
