<ul>
<li>Either you can prioritize responsiveness or deep focus.<ul>
<li>If you prioritize deep focus, you need to have some level of autonomy. Being completely reliant on someone else for a key piece of information that's blocking your work will disrupt your focus.</li>
<li>Complex projects are harder to achieve deep focus: you need input from others.</li>
<li>Blocking off time for <em>being unresponive</em>. Some people think managers / execs need to prioritize responsiveness, but that's definitely not the case.</li>
<li>Priotizing focus also also means you're more "present" when you are with other people. That helps make them feel important and increases the quality of your contributions.</li>
<li>Handling stress is another distraction. If you're too stretched out on many projects, you won't be able to focus. Need to find a way to feel good aobut what you're prioritizing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some days are much more productive than others: <ul>
<li>you slept well, you're excited.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Playing mental tricks with yourself.<ul>
<li>Getting started is the hardest part. "Put on my shoes." "Walk out the door." "Open my text editor."</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Public and private "tasks queue."</li>
<li>Tooling matters a lot.<ul>
<li>It's in vogue for managers to say "software can't fix this problem!" I think it's a way for them to strut and flex their "EQ" muscles, but there's something ironic about that.</li>
<li>Software is never a complete solution.</li>
</ul>
