# Web Scraping with Github Actions

- Did my first web scraping project 5 years ago, and decided to try another scraping project mostly to understand how difficult it might be to maintain a curated, publicly available dataset.

- the world has lots of new useful tools
- Using git as your "database" works fine for many projects. My project has just ~100MB of data _uncompressed_
- Using dbt for business logic transformations
- Using [Github releases](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/administering-a-repository/about-releases) for publishing your datasets
