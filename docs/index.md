Hi there, thanks for visiting.

My name's Tom, and I currently work as a data scientist at Facebook in their San Francisco office. Previously I worked as a product analyst at [Poll Everywhere](https://www.polleverywhere.com) and as a business  analyst at [Cartesian](https://www.cartesian.com). I graduated from Boston University in 2014 with a BA in math, and I'm originally from Philadelphia, PA.

This site is still a work in progress, but I'm starting to move my blog over here. You  can find my current writing over at [medium](https://www.medium.com/@tjwaterman99).
