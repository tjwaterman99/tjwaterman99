# Do it manually

- The stackoverflow surveys project. I spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to make the "data cleaning" process fully automated, even though I knew I'd only have to run it one time.
- Trying to do everything fully automated can be good, because it "proves fidelity," but its okay to relax a little bit your standards for "reproducibility." Requiring everyone to take the exact same download link and reproduce the project from those is just too much.
- I did discover some useful new tools, namely csvkit and pgloader.
- I avoided the manual work because it would have required installing a new tool (editing a CSV on vscode) and VSCode itself is kind of awkwaard to edit CSV files in. Having the right tool makes it much easier to jump into the type of work.
- The first time I tried doing this project, I wanted to automate everything from the links themselves. THe second time, it was from just the .csv files.
- Once I had the CSV files, it was more efficient to make progress by continueing rather than starting over. That's the symptom of effective work.
