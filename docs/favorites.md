## [95th percentile isn't that good](https://danluu.com/p95-skill/)

By Dan Luu.

As the author says in the first line - this sounds elitist, and maybe even condescending (and it's certainly click-baity). 

But the point of the article is actually the opposite: anyone that puts sustained, focused effort on improving can reach a comparatively rare ability. 

In my experience though, most people simply don't have an interest in sustaining that effort. Improvement is not a goal on their radar, and why should it be? There are plenty of other ways to live a fulfilling life, and there's only so much effort we can sustain in a day. It's almost selfish to focus on self-improvement so much, since that's time you can't spend on other things, like socializing or being with your family.

But for me personally, there's a unique kind of satisfaction that comes from doing things "better" than the time before. It can take just a few minutes at the end of the day to reflect on what happened and why it happened, and to think about what you might do differently next time.
