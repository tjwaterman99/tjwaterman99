# Productivity

- Either you can prioritize responsiveness or deep focus.
    - If you prioritize deep focus, you need to have some level of autonomy. Being completely reliant on someone else for a key piece of information that's blocking your work will disrupt your focus.
    - Complex projects are harder to achieve deep focus: you need input from others.
    - Blocking off time for _being unresponive_. Some people think managers / execs need to prioritize responsiveness, but that's definitely not the case.
- Some days are much more productive than others: 
    - you slept well, you're excited.
- Playing mental tricks with yourself.
    - Getting started is the hardest part. "Put on my shoes." "Walk out the door." "Open my text editor."
- Public and private "tasks queue."
- Tooling matters a lot.
    - It's in vogue for managers to say "software can't fix this problem!" I think it's a way for them to strut and flex their "EQ" muscles, but there's something ironic about that.
    - Software is never a complete solution.
