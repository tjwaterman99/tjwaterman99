## First thoughts on Github Codespaces

I wrote four months ago about [Github's announcement of Codespaces](https://www.corbettanalytics.com/github-announces-codespaces-a-web-based-ide/), and I was just invited to the public beta of the product.

I've been really excited about Codespaces, and I think [the github's browser-based editors is a pretty big deal](https://blog.robenkleene.com/2020/09/21/the-era-of-visual-studio-code/).

Here are my first thoughts on using Github codespaces:

- Viewing apps in your browser was straightforward
- The state of the workspace was saved between runs, and auto stopped after it was closed. I could find the pricing but that's way nicer than maintaining my own dev server.
- 64g of space available, not huge. I imagine they'll offer the option of more if you ever need it.
- Can you connect to the codespace from the vscode desktop app?
