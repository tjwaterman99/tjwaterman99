# What is an analytics engineer?

Today, analytics engineering is defined by using Data Build Tool (DBT) for building and managing the datasets in an organization's data warehouse. [As one of the founders has said](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24656588) (and I think it's fair): their product "has come to be synonymous with the practice of analytics engineering, defining an entire industry."

In fact the creators of DBT were the first to start using the title as far as I can tell, probably to try and distinguish their work from that of data engineers. I've heard them describe analytics engineering as the "Transform" part of "Extract, Load, Transform," and I think that's exactly right: [by using DBT, anyone can transform the raw data in their warehouses into much more useful forms](https://blog.getdbt.com/what-is-an-analytics-engineer/).

But defining the role of analytics engineering as synonymous with the tools that it requires feels like it's underselling the job. It's like defining software engineers as people that write Java, or defining consultants as people that make PowerPoint slides. 

As someone that's about to start an analytics engineering role in two weeks, I wanted to be able to define the role more by what I enabled the company to do, and less by the tools that I used to make that happen. What was I going to create at the company, beyond setting up a DBT repo and building some datasets in their warehouse?

Right now, I think investments at a company in analytics engineering is about improving these four capabilities:

1. Speed: 
2. Trust:
3. New Data Products:
4. Data Literacy:

### Improving Speed

- enabling analysts to contribute

### Increasing Trust

- Waiting to make decisions before the data is there
- Being more researchers than lawyers in how the data is used. What undermines that is usually speed, and/or being cynical.

### Building New Data Products

### Creating Data Literacy
