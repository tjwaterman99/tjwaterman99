# It's okay not to like fiction

When I was in college and high-school there was a huge emphasis on reading fiction: James Joyce, Dante, Zora Neal Hurston, Shakespeare, Aravand Adiga, Mark Twain, Aldous Huxely, Ralph Ellison, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and on and on. If we were ever assigned any non-fiction, they were over-structured text-books about history or ancient Greek philosophy.

I could never get into those stories at all. I'm sure part of that was a lack of appreciation for the stories, since it's hard as an 18 year old to grok the point the author is trying to make, especially when that author would use sentences that were 300 words long.

But some of the lack of appreciation was also an intentional part of the curriculum. The stories we were assigned to read were almost always stories that were far outside of our normal experience.
