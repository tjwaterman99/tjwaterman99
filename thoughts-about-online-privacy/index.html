<ul>
<li>Privacy isn't an absolute standard - there's no algorithm that can decide whether something is "private" or not. People feel differently about privacy, and overall Americans and Europeans are much more culturally concered about privacy than other parts of the world, that have different cultural traditions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also important to understand that there are few <em>legal gaurantees</em> about privacy that absolutely limit the United States government. The government can procure a search warrant and access almost anything they want: recording your phone calls, watching your internet traffic, and recording your location.</p>
<h2 id="first-party-tracking">First party tracking</h2>
<ul>
<li>How safeway does privacy today, which no one is concerned by: CCTV footage, "club cards" for tracking purchases, also tracking across your credit card number.</li>
<li>Many people are actually very excited by the features enabled from first-party tracking - think content recommendations from Netflix, your instagram and tiktok feeds.</li>
<li>How amazon does privacy today: every pageview, click, whether or not you have an account. But consumers don't get anything in exchange explicitly, so they feel it's not an agreement, but an invasion.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="third-party-tracking">Third party tracking</h2>
<ul>
<li>Third party cookies, the "facebook pixel"</li>
<li>Netflix movie on privacy that sent its cookies to Facebook</li>
<li>Currently being limited as much as possible, ie Iphone tracking also being limited.</li>
<li>But it's not really possible to limit this effectively from a technical perspective, and there just isn't much motivation for legal restrictions either.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="biometric-tracking">Biometric tracking</h2>
<ul>
<li>You might feel that your DNA is private, but you share your DNA with so many relatives that realistically it's already not private, and its possible to identify you through "genetic geneoalogy" today.</li>
<li>Commercial uses for nefarious reasons, such as healthcare coverage or insurance are pretty unlikely. The governments already limit the information those companies can use in their pricing, such as your race, so it's quite likely they'll just limit use of DNA as well.</li>
<li>The government itself can also be restrained by laws in how it uses DNA, and it's hard to see a use-case for them that's nefarious. The government's ability to offer more efficient, safer services based on biometric identification could actually be a huge benefit for citizens.</li>
<li>How will this affect things like immigration?</li>
