    <article class="post"><h1 id="whats-up-with-alteryx">What's up with Alteryx?</h1>
<p>Recently I chatted with a former coworker who was going to join Alteryx as a manager in their analytics group. We'd both used Alteryx at our first job, so I knew that it was really a competitor to the kind of analytics engineering function that's getting more popular in the Bay Area.</p>
<p>The biggest reason it's a competitor is that Alteryx strongly encourages you to extract your data out of a data warehouse or data lake, and onto the same computer that you've installed Alteryx. That also means a windows box by the way, since Alteryx doesn't support Mac or Linux at the time I'm writing this. Analytics engineering on the other hand is all about taking advantage of the capabilities of modern data warehouses like Snowflake, and maybe soon the lakehouses like Databricks.</p>
<p>So investors have described Alteryx's product recently by saying that it's "not cloud." There's no website you can log into and try Alteryx from your browser. You can't just add more nodes to your Alteryx cluster when you need more speed.</p>
<p>But Alteryx does occupy an amazingly lucrative segment in the analytics-tooling space: no code environments. The market for those kinds of products, including low-code app development environments, must be in the 10's of billions of dollars a year, and Alteryx itself took in about $500M in 2020.</p>
<p>What's going to happen to a product like that? On the one hand, Alteryx doesn't scale well for customers that need cloud-scale to handle their data, and it places a lot of burden on customers to upgrade their installation, manage their VMS, and so on. But the market they're serving has to be growing like crazy: companies must be hiring far more new analysts every year than they're hiring developers, and the vast majority of those analysts either can't or won't learn SQL for any reason.</p>
<p>There's definitely a spot for a company that can build a no-code UI to help analysts write their queries and send them to a database. Alteryx might be the company to do that, and getting it working "cloud first" is the easy part. Getting their drag-and-drop workflow to compile correctly to SQL every time is the part that could take an army of engineers.</p>
<p>My guess is they'll hit $1B in the next 5 years, and they only need a 15% CAGR to do it. Their sales multiple of 11x is relatively low right now compared to other software products too - that's similar to the megacaps like Microsoft. On paper they're cheap. </p>
<p>I'm also optimistic they'll be able to build out their product in a way that better leverages the benefits of the cloud. They might be a competitor in a way to analytics engineering, but there's definitely room for two approaches, and they might be a good pickup while the market has them down.</p></article>
