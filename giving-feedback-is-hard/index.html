<p>Helping other people with their work is hard: you need to be patient, encouraging, and able to contribute something that's actually constructive. </p>
<p>Your feedback will also fail to land unless your partner finishes the session feeling confident, which means you need to find the right moment to say - "and I want to know how it goes afterwards" - and it's hard to time that moment to coincide with exactly the end of a 30 minute one-on-one.</p>
<p>You also have to read the other person affectively: some people might interpret any "confidence building" you try do as belittling, while others may be completely uninterested in the constructive part, and really they're only interested in the "confidence building" part by itself.</p>
<p>This is all made even harder when the person asking for help hasn't practiced the best way to receive that help either. Sometimes the person may genuinely want your help, but they might feel argumentative, and their responses might turn you off the conversation because you'll feel you're not having any effect.</p>
<p>So I wanted to write this article as a kind of feedback for myself about how I'm doing feedback.</p>
<h2 id="listen-for-what-theyre-asking-for">Listen for what they're asking for</h2>
<ul>
<li>Is it confidence, or is it constructive?</li>
<li>Do you have the kind of relationship where they want to just "cut to the chase."</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="understand-where-theyre-at-in-the-process">Understand where they're at in the process</h2>
<ul>
<li>Is it late stages or early on, during their research? Try to understand where they're at, so that you can tailer your comments to their situation</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dont-race-to-the-finish-line">Don't race to the finish line</h2>
<ul>
<li>We want to finish every session with a complete, coherent plan about what to do next. Good luck with that!</li>
</ul></article>
